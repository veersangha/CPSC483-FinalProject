# CPSC483-FinalProject

We have included some example data, as well as a Colab to run a demo pipeline on this example data.

To use this, please open the Colab, and follow the instructions within (drag and drop the data from the example_data folder into the colab local home directory).

We have received permission to share these 5 de-identified ECGs from the Yale dataset, but because ECGs contain PHI, we cannot share any more data.

We have also included examples of the code and models we used to conduct the rest of the analyses on our server in other folder in this Repo.
